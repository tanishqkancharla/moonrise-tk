### Hi there 👋

I'm a web developer currently looking for my next opportunity. I studied physics and computer science at Carnegie Mellon University. 

In my free time, I love playing frisbee 🥏 and making lattes.

This repository contains some random thoughts of mine. I'm currently working on an interface to display them.

If you'd like to reach out to me, the best way is through my email (tkanchar@alumni.cmu.edu). If you'd like to learn more about me, my website is [moonrise.tk](https://moonrise.tk)
